# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Instead I'm going to thank whoever at HCSS might be reading this for taking the time to inspect my application so closely. If you're looking for the main logic for the perfect square validation, it is in https://github.com/LittleKingsguard/PerfectSquareDemo/blob/master/app/javascript/components/Square.jsx. I hope to hear back from you soon.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
